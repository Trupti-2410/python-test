| Design and Analyze Secure Networked Systems    | Cybersecurity Concepts and Security Principles | In this module, we will introduce the basic cyber security concepts, enable you to identity root causes of vulnerabilities in a network system and distinguish them from the threats from both inside and outside. We will analyze the enabling factors of recent cyber attack incidences and discuss the basic security services for their defense and triage. We will introduce the risk management framework for analyzing the risks in a network system, and apply the basic security design principles to protect the data and secure the computer systems. | 
|  -     | Protect Data Access and Verify Source of Trust    | In this module we apply principle of least privileges for controlling the proper access given to users and system process. We will demonstrate such an access control by using an example of project document access control using the Unix file access mechanism. We use OPM data breach example to show the impact and the need for principle of adequate data protection   |  
| - |Using GPG to Sign/Verify Software    | In this module, we introduce GPG software tool for generating public key private key pair for signing/verifying the documents and to encrypt documents, and publish our public key on our web server and PGP key server for others to retrieve. We will use GnuPG software tool to verify the common opensource software packages such as apache and putty. We will also learn how to sign software and the proper way to list the software package, their pgp signature, and our signing public key on a web site.   | 
| - | Be a CA, Setup Secure Server and Client Certificate| In this module, we will learn the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), how CA operates, and the certificates signing and verification process. We will utilize the utility command in a Linux system to serve as a CA for an organization, learn how to sign certificate request for clients or servers both secure email or secure web access purpose.	|
|Basic Cryptography and Programming with Crypto API | Basic Cryptography	| In this module we learn the basic concepts and principles of crytography, introduce the basic concept of cryptoanalysis using mono-alphabetic substitution cipher as an example, and discuss the one-time-pad and quantum key distribution concepts. |  
|-|Symmetric Key Cryptography |In this module we present the basic mechanism of symmetric key crytography algorithms, discuss the DES and AES standard, describe the criteria for selecting AES standard, present the block cipher operating modes and discuss how the block swapping attacks and replay attacks can be prevented and detected. |					
|- |	Asymmetric Key Cryptography	|In this module we will learn the modular arithmetic, the Euler Totient Theorm, the RSA Asymmetric Crypto Algorithm, use OpenSSL to realize the basic operations of RSA Crypto Algorithm, and Diffie-Hellman Symmetric Key Exchange Protocol to derive session keys.  	|	 
|- | Develop Secure Programs with Crypto API |In this module we will learn the modular arithmetic, the Euler Totient Theorm, the RSA Asymmetric Crypto Algorithm, use OpenSSL to realize the basic operations of RSA Crypto Algorithm, and Diffie-Hellman Symmetric Key Exchange Protocol to derive session keys.| 
|Hacking and Patching|Injection Web App Attacks and Their Defenses|In this module we will learn how to hack web app with command injection vulnerability with only four characters malicious string. We will learn how to hack web app with database backend with SQL injection vulnerability and potentially show the list of passwords by injecting string to overwrite SQL query. We will learn how to perform code review to spot the key statements/their patterns that expose the programs for such injection attacks and learn how to patch them. We will learn how to apply security design pattern to defend injection attacks and enhance web security.|
|-|Hack SQL Databases and Patch Web Apps with SQL Injection Vulnerabilities|In this module we will learn how to hack web app with database backend with SQL injection vulnerability and potentially show the list of passwords by injecting string to overwrite SQL query.We will learn how to perform code review to spot the key statements/their patterns that expose the programs for such injection attacks and learn how to patch them. We will learn the eight-step hacker methodology for exploit systems. For the escalating privilege techniques, we show how to leverage command injection vulnerability to search file systems and deposit/hide Trojans for future exploit.|
|-|Memory Attacks and Defenses|In this module, we learn about the typical protection mechanism provided by the modern OS to prevent process from accessing other pages data belong different process. We will also learn buffer overflow attacks and their common defenses.|
|-|Penetration Testing|In this module we will learn how to perform Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus tool, learn to perform penetration testing using tools included in Kali Linux distribution and to use Metasploit Framework to take control a vulnerable machine, deploy keylogger, run remote shell and remote VNC injection. We will also learn how to clone an AWS P2.xlarge GPU instance from a Ubuntu image with hashcat software to crack passwords.|
|Secure Networked System with Firewall and IDS|Secure Network Defense|In this module, we will learn how to construct an DMZ firewall system with dual firewalls to protect a site. We will also learn how to define critical security policies, their enforcement procedures, and apply related security design principles for the firewall system.|
|-|Implement Firewall with Linux IPTable|In this module, we will learn how to use Linux iptables to implement firewall rules for filtering packets, and SNAPT or DNAT address port translation, and the security policies.|
|-|Intrusion Detection Systems|In this module we will introduce the Snort IDS, discuss evaluation and performance of network firewalls, and finally cover Host IDS.|
